<p id="description">5x5 Multiplayer Chess Game with WebSockets Overview This project implements a 5x5 chess game designed for multiplayer functionality using WebSockets. The game allows multiple players to connect in real-time and play chess on a smaller board than the traditional 8x8 version. The implementation leverages WebSocket technology to facilitate real-time communication between players enabling an interactive and engaging gaming experience. Key Features Real-time Multiplayer: Players can join the game and make moves that are immediately reflected on all connected clients using WebSockets. Interactive Chessboard: A responsive 5x5 chessboard where players can interact with each cell to make moves. Move Validation: Ensures that moves are valid according to chess rules adapted for the 5x5 board. Game State Management: Tracks and updates the game state including player turns game status (e.g. checkmate stalemate) and player moves. Technology Stack Frontend: Built using React.js (or Next.js) to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. Backend: Developed with Node.js and Express.js to handle WebSocket connections and game logic. WebSockets: Implemented using socket.io to manage real-time communication between clients and the server.</p>
